chin up
=======

### Why? ###
To become the best I can be, I need motivation, I need to get my chin up.

### How do you measure? ###
Every metric that I believe significantly effects my motivation and health will be measured on a scale frome 1 to 10.
If there is something significant to note, I'll put that down as well. However, the main goal is to motivate myself through
numbers and statistics.

**1 being** the worst, least effort I could possibly put in and **10 being** the best, most effort I could possibly put in.

### When will you be... done? ###
I don't ever expect to be a 10 in all areas all the time, so there will always be room for improvement! I need/want some
motivation in my life these days. It's strange being 25 and having your whole life ahead of you. So crippling to want to
pursue Jiu Jitsu, Fishing, Programming, Gaming, Olympic Lifting, Powerlifting, Traveling, starting a family, etc. etc.

It's difficult to make a decision, especially because of my personality type always wanting to do things perfectly/the right way.
I'm hoping this helps me pursue all of those things by simply being a healthy and happy person.

### Isn't this just like a really dumbed down workout tracker? ###
Totally.

It's not meant to be for one specific goal, but all of my goals boiled down to their most basic components. "Am I motivated"
is the biggest question I ask myself every day. Ever since my family has left I'm having a hard time feeling
any worth or contribution to society.

Sometimes it feels like even if I got a world record, made a million dollar idea come to fruition, or wrote some amazing
novel programming library I'd still feel unhappy. That's why I need to start worrying about these metrics.
