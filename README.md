### Why? ###
To become the best I can be, I need motivation, I need to get my chin up.

### How do you measure? ###
Every metric I believe that significantly effects my motivation and health I will measure on a scale frome 1 to 10.

**1 being** the worst, least effort I could possibly put in

**10 being** the best, most effort I could possibly put in
